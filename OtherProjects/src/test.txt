Zhang Xiaofan slowly opened his eyes.

In front of him were not the mountains and caves as he had imagined, all around him was a terrifying desolation.

An endless stretch of desert, without a single leaf or blade of grass, all around were just piles of sand and rocks, the wind blew and blew away the dust. Above his head was a majestic blue sky, dark purple clouds pressed down heavily as if to sink people to the ground. In that strange layer of clouds, bright lightning bolts shot towards the distant horizon.

That horizon was a dark blue sky, countless brilliant stars shining brightly. Zhang Xiaofan withdrew his gaze and looked ahead. In the cold desert, in the distance stood an altar built from large stone slabs, with steps seven stories high on all four sides. On the altar were seven large pillars, each pillar was ten zhang tall, as big as three human arms. In the middle of the altar was an ancient incense burner. An old man was leaning against the cauldron, looking extremely tired. That old man was staring intently at Zhang Xiaofan.

Xiaofan recognized that person, and couldn't help but shiver. That old man was indeed Dao Xuan Zhenren, the current head of Qingyun Sect.

A cold black aura was hovering around Dao Xuan Zhenren, and upon closer inspection, he no longer had the appearance of a Taoist immortal commanding the world like he knew before, but only exuded an indescribable viciousness.

Dao Xuan Zhenren lazily stood up, and suddenly laughed out loud: "I didn't expect you to have passed through the Ao Yue Dao by yourself, very good!"

Zhang Xiaofan pondered for a moment, then turned around and looked up, only to see that the place he had just stepped out of was a towering stone door, completely unlike the desolate scene of the surrounding world. Inside the stone door, the path he had just passed through was faintly visible, faintly visible in the fluttering white smoke. That seemingly harmless and harmless road, it seemed like it would take him a lifetime to walk through it.

Zhang Xiaofan recalled the pain he had just experienced, and a feeling of fear suddenly arose in his heart. But after a moment, a smile appeared on the corner of his lips, and he turned back to face Daoxuan Zhenren.

The person in front of him, could be said to have directly caused the death of his beloved master Tian Buyi, who he respected the most, and also indirectly killed his master's wife Su Ru, but now he was incredibly old and weak, and no longer had any of his previous intimidating appearance. In Zhang Xiaofan's heart, there was not even the slightest thought of revenge.

"Are you okay?" Zhang Xiaofan walked in front of Daoxuan Zhenren, and asked calmly.

Daoxuan Zhenren looked at him, a strange smile suddenly appeared on his tired face, not mentioning any past grudges, but only asking a seemingly meaningless question: "What are you doing here?"

Zhang Xiaofan pondered for a moment, then replied: "I feel like I'll come if I want to!"

Daoxuan Zhenren stared at him, then shook his head and laughed: "Very good, if I want to come, then come, hahaha..."

His laughter became more and more crazy, the expression on his face seemed to become more and more intense. Zhang Xiaofan just stood there quietly watching. After a long while, Daoxuan Zhenren stopped laughing, his expression suddenly became extremely tired.

"Aren't you going to avenge your master?"

Daoxuan Zhenren suddenly asked harshly. Zhang Xiaofan didn't answer, still standing there quietly looking at him. His eyes were calm and composed, seemingly hiding a bit of sadness. The monkey Xiaohui suddenly moved and crawled out to sit on his shoulder.

Daoxuan Zhenren's body suddenly jerked, his expression gradually changed. The tiredness disappeared, his eyes suddenly lit up strangely. The world-shaking aura rose like a tidal wave, quickly invading his entire being.

That terrifying invisible power made Xiao Fan narrow his eyes. Dao Xuan Zhenren stood up, the black aura on his body quickly surrounded Zhang Xiao Fan. He stared at him, sneering viciously: "Then, are you afraid?"

Suddenly a loud "Bang" came from behind Dao Xuan Zhenren, the ancient cauldron shattered in an instant, fragments flying in all directions. Zhang Xiao Fan took a step back, raising his hand to cover his face.

A sword fell from the ancient cauldron, the sharp blade embedded into the stone platform like it was stuck in mud.

Tru Tien Ancient Sword!

"Ha ha ha ha ha!"

The black aura swirled and covered Dao Xuan Zhenren, he stretched out his hand. As if it had a spirit, Tru Tien Ancient Sword shook and bounced off the stone, flying into Dao Xuan's hand while his crazy laughter continued.

"If you are so useless, then let me send you to see your master, ha ha ha ha...!"

Dao Xuan Zhenren laughed evilly, exerting his strength to grip the handle of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword. In an instant, the entire giant altar shook. A terrifying power emanated from the ancient sword, causing the seven stone pillars to shake and shine, the light growing stronger and stronger. Finally, all seven stone pillars transformed into seven dazzling seven-colored pillars of light, shining straight up into the sky.

The seven seven-colored pillars of light pierced straight through the clouds. In an instant, the thick clouds above the altar began to rotate violently. Flashes of lightning split the sky, faintly revealing the scene of the Heavenly Palace.

Zhang Xiaofan held his breath and looked up at the sky. Only then did he understand why this place was called the Ao Yue Cave Mansion.

The towering Heavenly Palace was torn apart by the terrifying power of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword, revealing a bright and mysterious moon. The colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple flickered on the distant Ao Yue, emitting mysterious and brilliant lights.

The seven pillars of light on the altar suddenly rose and merged with the Ao Yue, making the Ao Yue's light even stronger, the seven colors flashing continuously. The next moment, a seven-colored sword appeared from within the Ao Yue. Wherever the sword went, the dark clouds disappeared, its terrifying power was unimaginable if one did not see it.

Zhang Xiaofan's face had turned pale, he had never witnessed such power before, it was truly an invincible ancient and modern sword formation! In just a moment, countless Tru Tien Ancient Swords appeared and flew across the sky. Under the light of the Illusionary Moon, the master sword became more and more majestic and powerful, even more powerful than when it was on the altar.

The eyes of Dao Xuan Zhenren changed from bright to dark, and a cold laughter rang out as if piercing Zhang Xiaofan's ears:

"In the Illusionary Moon Cave Mansion, the power of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword is even more powerful. Even if you are a Great Luo Golden Immortal, your bones will be crushed to pieces, understand?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the sword in his hand spun again, and in an instant, the sky and earth shook, the wind and clouds changed color, and thunder rumbled in the sky. In the blue sky, the great sword appeared and disappeared, pointing straight at Zhang Xiaofan.

The sword shadow swooped down, and a storm arose. Zhang Xiaofan understood that he could not resist, and there was no way to dodge. Who would have thought that even the heavens would have to turn before the Tru Tien Ancient Sword? A ray of light covered the entire altar, seemingly crushing Xiaofan's body. Under that terrible weight, his legs gradually collapsed. The ground beneath his feet shook unceasingly. Within a few dozen square meters, the ground cracked open like a turtle's hood.

The power of the sword was unimaginable. Ever since the Tru Tien Ancient Sword broke and lay under the Ao Nguyet, no one expected its power to be stronger than ever. Heaven and earth were still cracking, how could humans survive? No matter how high one's cultivation was, one could only close one's eyes and wait for death!

In that moment between life and death, Zhang Xiaofan's heart was extremely calm, like someone who had traveled far away and was about to return home, his lips still showing a calm and composed smile.

Perhaps the Heavens did not want him to die. When Zhang Xiaofan was about to die, a call came from afar.

"Senior Brother, stop!"

The voice sounded very youthful, but there was an immense power hidden in it. It seemed like that person just said it casually, but that short sentence shook people's hearts, making their blood boil.

Heaven and earth were turned upside down, ghosts and gods could not stop the power of the Tru Tien ancient sword. Suddenly, everything stopped, it seemed like Dao Xuan Zhenren with his invincible power in his hand had to be wary of that voice. The vicious features on his face suddenly disappeared, he looked behind Xiao Fan in shock. His voice also became intermittently trembling.

"Junior brother... Junior brother Wan...!"

The pressure on Xiao Fan's body suddenly disappeared, the cracks under his feet also reconnected as if nothing had happened. Looking back, he only saw a white-clothed figure standing right next to the door where he had just passed.

It was a handsome young man, a warm smile on his lips, his eyes exuding enthusiasm and trust. The desert wind blew strongly, the white robe on his body fluttered, elegant and proud. Looking at that person, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt a sense of admiration and love. As long as that person said one word, he would not hesitate to follow him to the ends of the earth!

The endless blue sky, the sparkling Ao Yue.

The two elite disciples of Qingyun Sect, separated for so many years, now met again in a mysterious and empty space.

The body of Dao Xuan Zhenren slowly trembled, the Tru Tien Ancient Sword in his hand slowly lowered. He walked heavily away from the altar, walking towards that white figure, not even looking at Zhang Xiaofan.

The white robe fluttered, the radiant face of the passionate past in his memories emitted a bright light. That warm and passionate light was once the most dear thing in Dao Xuan Zhenren's heart. His eyes, which had long been dry, shed hot tears: "Junior Brother... is it really you?"

The white-clothed youth stood there, not moving away from the stone door, smiling: "Senior Brother, how are you? How long has it been since we last saw each other?"

Dao Xuan Zhenren's entire body trembled slightly, even though he still held the ancient Tru Tien sword in his hand, the dark energy on his body had completely dissipated. At that moment, the pain in Zhang Xiaofan's body disappeared, and his expression returned to a calm and composed state.

Mount Qingyun, as high as the heavens.

From the summit, the horizon no longer stretched out in its usual infinite blue. Instead, ominous blood-red clouds were gathering, slowly creeping toward the peak of Mount Qingyun.

Within the Qingyun Sect, chaos reigned like never before. The infiltration by the Demonic Cult this time had unleashed an unimaginable force. In a single day, the righteous sects had lost nearly all of their strength, standing on the brink of annihilation. Their downfall was not just due to the brutal battles, but also the mysterious and sinister sorcery wielded by the Ghost King. Under this malevolent power, righteous disciples could no longer recognize their comrades, turning on one another as though sworn enemies.

With but a wave of his hand, the Ghost King had thrown heaven and earth into turmoil. Countless righteous cultivators had lost their minds, becoming ruthless killing machines under the control of the Demonic Cult. Now, with over a hundred thousand under his command, the Ghost King had forged a force powerful enough to shake the very heavens.

Qingyun Sect was the last bastion of the righteous path. Even the once-prestigious Tianyin Temple had fallen into enemy hands, leaving only a dozen high-ranking monks who had managed to escape and now sought refuge with the Qingyun Sect. Among them were the venerable Abbot Puhong, the divine monk Pukong, and the gifted disciple Faxiang. One other figure stood quietly among them — a gaunt, silent elder monk who always remained by Abbot Puhong’s side.

News of the Tianyin Temple’s calamity stirred the sect. For years, the Qingyun Sect and the Tianyin Temple had shared a close alliance, always standing shoulder to shoulder in times of crisis. As the monks approached the sect's main hall, the disciples of Qingyun gathered en masse to welcome them. But upon seeing the monks’ bloodstained robes and grief-stricken faces, a heavy silence fell upon the crowd.

The leadership of Qingyun Sect now fell to Xiao Yicai, who was temporarily handling affairs, along with Zeng Shuchang of Great Bamboo Peak and Master Shuiyue of Small Bamboo Peak. Zeng Shuchang scanned the monks’ faces and saw only sorrow. Their bloodied robes told tales of desperate battle. Tianyin Temple had once flourished with disciples — and now, only a handful remained. Could it be...

Zeng Shuchang stepped forward, hesitating before asking with difficulty, “Venerable Abbot Puhong, the others… have they…”

Abbot Puhong clasped his hands solemnly in greeting. “In this great disaster, all beings are but ashes. We monks of Tianyin sought to save lives, but as our skills grew by an inch, the demonic sorcery grew by a yard. Most of our disciples have perished.”

With that, he sighed and murmured, “Amitabha.”

Zeng Shuchang remained silent, his expression pained. Xiao Yicai tried to remain composed, but the forced smile on his face betrayed the weight of sorrow: “Regardless, your arrival is a blessing. Please, come inside.”

The monks clasped their hands in return and followed him toward the Jade Heaven Hall. Behind them, the blood-red clouds loomed heavier, as though threatening to crush the sky itself.

Master Shuiyue turned to see her disciple Lu Xueqi lingering by the railing of a side stair, gazing into the distance with a troubled expression. She opened her mouth to call out, then paused, seemingly recalling something. Quietly, she approached and said softly, “Xueqi.”

Startled, Lu Xueqi turned and quickly nodded, “Master, I’ll be there shortly.”

She was about to step forward when Shuiyue gently grasped her hand and led her aside.

Lu Xueqi looked at her, puzzled. “Master, what is this?”

Shuiyue exhaled deeply, lowered her voice, and said with great tenderness, “Xueqi, you must leave.”

Lu Xueqi’s eyes widened. “Master, where should I go?”

The master’s gaze fell upon the distant blood-red clouds. Her voice dropped even lower. “Leave Mount Qingyun. Find the one you long for. Go to a place where your heart belongs. Live a happy life… with the one you love.”

She turned her eyes toward her disciple, her tone resolute. “Never come back.”

Lu Xueqi turned pale. Tears welled up in her eyes. After a long pause, she shook her head and whispered firmly, “Master, I won’t go. I want to stay here with you.”

Shuiyue smiled bitterly. “Foolish child, I’ve lived a long life. I have no regrets, even if I die today. But you are young, and you have love in your life. Please, listen to me. Leave Mount Qingyun. Go and be with the one you love…”

Tears streamed down Lu Xueqi’s face. Her whole body trembled as she struggled with the storm of emotions inside her. But in the end, she turned and walked toward the Jade Heaven Hall.

Master Shuiyue watched her slender figure recede into the distance, sighed heavily, and slowly followed. She paused, glancing toward a corner of the courtyard where a young man and woman whispered to one another. The girl was her disciple Wen Min, and the man, Song Daren of Great Bamboo Peak. Worry lined their faces, but the way they looked at each other — so tender, so full of affection — made her heart ache even more.

She lowered her eyes and continued toward the hall.

Inside, the disciples and monks had taken their seats. Though the revered Abbot Puhong was offered the seat of honor, he firmly declined, and so the chair remained empty. The representatives of the righteous sects filled the hall.

Zeng Shuchang cleared his throat and asked, “Venerable Abbot, has the area surrounding Tianyin Temple also been destroyed by the demonic cult?”

Abbot Puhong shook his head. “The merciful Buddha still watches over the common people. The demon cult has yet to reach them. But hearing that the evil ones had returned to slaughter and bring calamity, we came to stop them. Alas, their sorcery is powerful beyond belief. Many of our disciples have perished. Ah… I have failed them.”

The hall fell silent in mourning. Xiao Yicai gently said, “Venerable One, please don’t blame yourself. Those who perished have gone on to paradise. What matters now is how we resist the demonic scourge.”

Abbot Puhong sighed, glancing around at the disciples of Qingyun Sect. “The situation is dire. Only your sect’s Master Dao Xuan remains as the last hope of the righteous path. The mighty Zhu Xian Sword Formation may yet turn the tide and save the people. Amitabha… I entrust this to you.”

He bowed deeply. To his surprise, the Qingyun disciples all averted their eyes in silence. The abbot’s brows furrowed. “Forgive me for asking…”

Xiao Yicai forced a bitter smile. “Perhaps the Venerable One has not yet heard… our master… has been missing for days.”

The monks of Tianyin Temple exchanged shocked glances. Abbot Puhong asked gravely, “What happened?”

Xiao Yicai sighed. “There’s no need to hide the truth anymore. Ever since Master Dao Xuan used the Zhu Xian Formation to defeat the Beast God, he began to show strange behavior…”

A flood of blood-red surged across the sky.

Above Thông Thiên Peak, the entire sky had turned a deep crimson. Towering black clouds rolled and churned, making it hard to breathe just by looking. Beneath that blood-red canopy, everything was stained the same hue—red sky, red mountains, the mist drifting over the sea of clouds was red, the droplets trickling beneath the Scarlet Bridge were red, even the harsh mountain winds seemed tinged with red.

The stench of blood wafted thickly in the air, rising to flood Thông Thiên Peak.

From all directions, people swarmed up the mountain in droves, so densely packed that not a single gap could be seen. Everywhere, people crawled and scrambled, their eyes gleaming an eerie, bloodshot red. Judging by their clothing, most of these frenzied masses were common folk from the foot of Qing Yun Mountain. But how could mere civilians move with such agility, like monkeys or apes? Naturally, it was the influence of that eerie crimson light that had stolen their sanity.

With no real effort, the Ghost King had summoned such a vast army through the Four Sacred Blood Formation. And with the same formation, he had turned weak-willed villagers into powerful berserkers capable of overwhelming forces many times their strength. It was enough to prove that there was no conceivable way to counter his power. One crazed commoner might be nothing to a disciple of Qing Yun Sect, but what about a hundred, a thousand? Now, there were nearly a hundred thousand of them, covering the forests and mountains like a maddened swarm of ants. The sight alone was enough to make one's hair stand on end.

Among the writhing throng were many whose excitement over the blood-colored sky was especially intense. Their cultivation was clearly far beyond that of the frenzied commoners around them. They flew swiftly on swords, mimicking the techniques of true cultivators—and not poorly either. Some of them even surpassed the Qing Yun disciples stationed there. It was no mystery why—these were righteous cultivators who had once fought in previous battles, but whose minds had now been seized by the Ghost King.

With so many elite fighters and an endless tide of madmen, the Demonic Sect’s assault surged like an unstoppable tidal wave crashing ashore. Beneath the blood-soaked sky, the Qing Yun disciples guarding Vân Hải could barely hold their ground. They fell back, retreating in clusters toward the Scarlet Bridge.

Before long, accompanied by wave after wave of ominous shuffling sounds, the Demonic Sect’s army from all directions had overrun the vast plaza of Vân Hải. The once ethereal mountain, wreathed in drifting clouds, had become a roiling sea of heads and a cacophony of shrieks and howls. It was a scene straight from the abyss. More and more people poured in—until there was no room left even to stand.

Zhang Xiaofan slowly opened his eyes.

In front of him were not the mountains and caves as he had imagined, all around him was a terrifying desolation.

An endless stretch of desert, without a single leaf or blade of grass, all around were just piles of sand and rocks, the wind blew and blew away the dust. Above his head was a majestic blue sky, dark purple clouds pressed down heavily as if to sink people to the ground. In that strange layer of clouds, bright lightning bolts shot towards the distant horizon.

That horizon was a dark blue sky, countless brilliant stars shining brightly. Zhang Xiaofan withdrew his gaze and looked ahead. In the cold desert, in the distance stood an altar built from large stone slabs, with steps seven stories high on all four sides. On the altar were seven large pillars, each pillar was ten zhang tall, as big as three human arms. In the middle of the altar was an ancient incense burner. An old man was leaning against the cauldron, looking extremely tired. That old man was staring intently at Zhang Xiaofan.

Xiaofan recognized that person, and couldn't help but shiver. That old man was indeed Dao Xuan Zhenren, the current head of Qingyun Sect.

A cold black aura was hovering around Dao Xuan Zhenren, and upon closer inspection, he no longer had the appearance of a Taoist immortal commanding the world like he knew before, but only exuded an indescribable viciousness.

Dao Xuan Zhenren lazily stood up, and suddenly laughed out loud: "I didn't expect you to have passed through the Ao Yue Dao by yourself, very good!"

Zhang Xiaofan pondered for a moment, then turned around and looked up, only to see that the place he had just stepped out of was a towering stone door, completely unlike the desolate scene of the surrounding world. Inside the stone door, the path he had just passed through was faintly visible, faintly visible in the fluttering white smoke. That seemingly harmless and harmless road, it seemed like it would take him a lifetime to walk through it.

Zhang Xiaofan recalled the pain he had just experienced, and a feeling of fear suddenly arose in his heart. But after a moment, a smile appeared on the corner of his lips, and he turned back to face Daoxuan Zhenren.

The person in front of him, could be said to have directly caused the death of his beloved master Tian Buyi, who he respected the most, and also indirectly killed his master's wife Su Ru, but now he was incredibly old and weak, and no longer had any of his previous intimidating appearance. In Zhang Xiaofan's heart, there was not even the slightest thought of revenge.

"Are you okay?" Zhang Xiaofan walked in front of Daoxuan Zhenren, and asked calmly.

Daoxuan Zhenren looked at him, a strange smile suddenly appeared on his tired face, not mentioning any past grudges, but only asking a seemingly meaningless question: "What are you doing here?"

Zhang Xiaofan pondered for a moment, then replied: "I feel like I'll come if I want to!"

Daoxuan Zhenren stared at him, then shook his head and laughed: "Very good, if I want to come, then come, hahaha..."

His laughter became more and more crazy, the expression on his face seemed to become more and more intense. Zhang Xiaofan just stood there quietly watching. After a long while, Daoxuan Zhenren stopped laughing, his expression suddenly became extremely tired.

"Aren't you going to avenge your master?"

Daoxuan Zhenren suddenly asked harshly. Zhang Xiaofan didn't answer, still standing there quietly looking at him. His eyes were calm and composed, seemingly hiding a bit of sadness. The monkey Xiaohui suddenly moved and crawled out to sit on his shoulder.

Daoxuan Zhenren's body suddenly jerked, his expression gradually changed. The tiredness disappeared, his eyes suddenly lit up strangely. The world-shaking aura rose like a tidal wave, quickly invading his entire being.

That terrifying invisible power made Xiao Fan narrow his eyes. Dao Xuan Zhenren stood up, the black aura on his body quickly surrounded Zhang Xiao Fan. He stared at him, sneering viciously: "Then, are you afraid?"

Suddenly a loud "Bang" came from behind Dao Xuan Zhenren, the ancient cauldron shattered in an instant, fragments flying in all directions. Zhang Xiao Fan took a step back, raising his hand to cover his face.

A sword fell from the ancient cauldron, the sharp blade embedded into the stone platform like it was stuck in mud.

Tru Tien Ancient Sword!

"Ha ha ha ha ha!"

The black aura swirled and covered Dao Xuan Zhenren, he stretched out his hand. As if it had a spirit, Tru Tien Ancient Sword shook and bounced off the stone, flying into Dao Xuan's hand while his crazy laughter continued.

"If you are so useless, then let me send you to see your master, ha ha ha ha...!"

Dao Xuan Zhenren laughed evilly, exerting his strength to grip the handle of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword. In an instant, the entire giant altar shook. A terrifying power emanated from the ancient sword, causing the seven stone pillars to shake and shine, the light growing stronger and stronger. Finally, all seven stone pillars transformed into seven dazzling seven-colored pillars of light, shining straight up into the sky.

The seven seven-colored pillars of light pierced straight through the clouds. In an instant, the thick clouds above the altar began to rotate violently. Flashes of lightning split the sky, faintly revealing the scene of the Heavenly Palace.

Zhang Xiaofan held his breath and looked up at the sky. Only then did he understand why this place was called the Ao Yue Cave Mansion.

The towering Heavenly Palace was torn apart by the terrifying power of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword, revealing a bright and mysterious moon. The colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple flickered on the distant Ao Yue, emitting mysterious and brilliant lights.

The seven pillars of light on the altar suddenly rose and merged with the Ao Yue, making the Ao Yue's light even stronger, the seven colors flashing continuously. The next moment, a seven-colored sword appeared from within the Ao Yue. Wherever the sword went, the dark clouds disappeared, its terrifying power was unimaginable if one did not see it.

Zhang Xiaofan's face had turned pale, he had never witnessed such power before, it was truly an invincible ancient and modern sword formation! In just a moment, countless Tru Tien Ancient Swords appeared and flew across the sky. Under the light of the Illusionary Moon, the master sword became more and more majestic and powerful, even more powerful than when it was on the altar.

The eyes of Dao Xuan Zhenren changed from bright to dark, and a cold laughter rang out as if piercing Zhang Xiaofan's ears:

"In the Illusionary Moon Cave Mansion, the power of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword is even more powerful. Even if you are a Great Luo Golden Immortal, your bones will be crushed to pieces, understand?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the sword in his hand spun again, and in an instant, the sky and earth shook, the wind and clouds changed color, and thunder rumbled in the sky. In the blue sky, the great sword appeared and disappeared, pointing straight at Zhang Xiaofan.

The sword shadow swooped down, and a storm arose. Zhang Xiaofan understood that he could not resist, and there was no way to dodge. Who would have thought that even the heavens would have to turn before the Tru Tien Ancient Sword? A ray of light covered the entire altar, seemingly crushing Xiaofan's body. Under that terrible weight, his legs gradually collapsed. The ground beneath his feet shook unceasingly. Within a few dozen square meters, the ground cracked open like a turtle's hood.

The power of the sword was unimaginable. Ever since the Tru Tien Ancient Sword broke and lay under the Ao Nguyet, no one expected its power to be stronger than ever. Heaven and earth were still cracking, how could humans survive? No matter how high one's cultivation was, one could only close one's eyes and wait for death!

In that moment between life and death, Zhang Xiaofan's heart was extremely calm, like someone who had traveled far away and was about to return home, his lips still showing a calm and composed smile.

Perhaps the Heavens did not want him to die. When Zhang Xiaofan was about to die, a call came from afar.

"Senior Brother, stop!"

The voice sounded very youthful, but there was an immense power hidden in it. It seemed like that person just said it casually, but that short sentence shook people's hearts, making their blood boil.

Heaven and earth were turned upside down, ghosts and gods could not stop the power of the Tru Tien ancient sword. Suddenly, everything stopped, it seemed like Dao Xuan Zhenren with his invincible power in his hand had to be wary of that voice. The vicious features on his face suddenly disappeared, he looked behind Xiao Fan in shock. His voice also became intermittently trembling.

"Junior brother... Junior brother Wan...!"

The pressure on Xiao Fan's body suddenly disappeared, the cracks under his feet also reconnected as if nothing had happened. Looking back, he only saw a white-clothed figure standing right next to the door where he had just passed.

It was a handsome young man, a warm smile on his lips, his eyes exuding enthusiasm and trust. The desert wind blew strongly, the white robe on his body fluttered, elegant and proud. Looking at that person, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt a sense of admiration and love. As long as that person said one word, he would not hesitate to follow him to the ends of the earth!

The endless blue sky, the sparkling Ao Yue.

The two elite disciples of Qingyun Sect, separated for so many years, now met again in a mysterious and empty space.

The body of Dao Xuan Zhenren slowly trembled, the Tru Tien Ancient Sword in his hand slowly lowered. He walked heavily away from the altar, walking towards that white figure, not even looking at Zhang Xiaofan.

The white robe fluttered, the radiant face of the passionate past in his memories emitted a bright light. That warm and passionate light was once the most dear thing in Dao Xuan Zhenren's heart. His eyes, which had long been dry, shed hot tears: "Junior Brother... is it really you?"

The white-clothed youth stood there, not moving away from the stone door, smiling: "Senior Brother, how are you? How long has it been since we last saw each other?"

Dao Xuan Zhenren's entire body trembled slightly, even though he still held the ancient Tru Tien sword in his hand, the dark energy on his body had completely dissipated. At that moment, the pain in Zhang Xiaofan's body disappeared, and his expression returned to a calm and composed state.

Mount Qingyun, as high as the heavens.

From the summit, the horizon no longer stretched out in its usual infinite blue. Instead, ominous blood-red clouds were gathering, slowly creeping toward the peak of Mount Qingyun.

Within the Qingyun Sect, chaos reigned like never before. The infiltration by the Demonic Cult this time had unleashed an unimaginable force. In a single day, the righteous sects had lost nearly all of their strength, standing on the brink of annihilation. Their downfall was not just due to the brutal battles, but also the mysterious and sinister sorcery wielded by the Ghost King.

Countless righteous cultivators had lost their minds, becoming ruthless killing machines under the control of the Demonic Cult. Now, with over a hundred thousand under his command, the Ghost King had forged a force powerful enough to shake the very heavens.

Qingyun Sect was the last bastion of the righteous path. Even the once-prestigious Tianyin Temple had fallen into enemy hands, leaving only a dozen high-ranking monks who had managed to escape and now sought refuge with the Qingyun Sect. Among them were the venerable Abbot Puhong, the divine monk Pukong, and the gifted disciple Faxiang.

As the monks approached the sect's main hall, the disciples of Qingyun gathered en masse to welcome them. But upon seeing the monks’ bloodstained robes and grief-stricken faces, a heavy silence fell upon the crowd.

The leadership of Qingyun Sect now fell to Xiao Yicai, who was temporarily handling affairs, along with Zeng Shuchang of Great Bamboo Peak and Master Shuiyue of Small Bamboo Peak. Zeng Shuchang scanned the monks’ faces and saw only sorrow. Their bloodied robes told tales of desperate battle. Tianyin Temple had once flourished with disciples — and now, only a handful remained. Could it be...

Zeng Shuchang stepped forward, hesitating before asking with difficulty, “Venerable Abbot Puhong, the others… have they…”

Abbot Puhong clasped his hands solemnly in greeting. “In this great disaster, all beings are but ashes. We monks of Tianyin sought to save lives, but as our skills grew by an inch, the demonic sorcery grew by a yard. Most of our disciples have perished.”

With that, he sighed and murmured, “Amitabha.”

Zeng Shuchang remained silent, his expression pained. Xiao Yicai tried to remain composed, but the forced smile on his face betrayed the weight of sorrow: “Regardless, your arrival is a blessing. Please, come inside.”

The monks clasped their hands in return and followed him toward the Jade Heaven Hall. Behind them, the blood-red clouds loomed heavier, as though threatening to crush the sky itself.

Master Shuiyue turned to see her disciple Lu Xueqi lingering by the railing of a side stair, gazing into the distance with a troubled expression. She opened her mouth to call out, then paused, seemingly recalling something. Quietly, she approached and said softly, “Xueqi.”

Startled, Lu Xueqi turned and quickly nodded, “Master, I’ll be there shortly.”

She was about to step forward when Shuiyue gently grasped her hand and led her aside.

Lu Xueqi looked at her, puzzled. “Master, what is this?”

Shuiyue exhaled deeply, lowered her voice, and said with great tenderness, “Xueqi, you must leave.”

Lu Xueqi’s eyes widened. “Master, where should I go?”

The master’s gaze fell upon the distant blood-red clouds. Her voice dropped even lower. “Leave Mount Qingyun. Find the one you long for. Go to a place where your heart belongs. Live a happy life… with the one you love.”

She turned her eyes toward her disciple, her tone resolute. “Never come back.”

Lu Xueqi turned pale. Tears welled up in her eyes. After a long pause, she shook her head and whispered firmly, “Master, I won’t go. I want to stay here with you.”

Shuiyue smiled bitterly. “Foolish child, I’ve lived a long life. I have no regrets, even if I die today. But you are young, and you have love in your life. Please, listen to me. Leave Mount Qingyun. Go and be with the one you love…”

Tears streamed down Lu Xueqi’s face. Her whole body trembled as she struggled with the storm of emotions inside her. But in the end, she turned and walked toward the Jade Heaven Hall.

Master Shuiyue watched her slender figure recede into the distance, sighed heavily, and slowly followed. She paused, glancing toward a corner of the courtyard where a young man and woman whispered to one another. The girl was her disciple Wen Min, and the man, Song Daren of Great Bamboo Peak. Worry lined their faces, but the way they looked at each other — so tender, so full of affection — made her heart ache even more.

She lowered her eyes and continued toward the hall.

Inside, the disciples and monks had taken their seats. Though the revered Abbot Puhong was offered the seat of honor, he firmly declined, and so the chair remained empty. The representatives of the righteous sects filled the hall.

Zeng Shuchang cleared his throat and asked, “Venerable Abbot, has the area surrounding Tianyin Temple also been destroyed by the demonic cult?”

Abbot Puhong shook his head. “The merciful Buddha still watches over the common people. The demon cult has yet to reach them. But hearing that the evil ones had returned to slaughter and bring calamity, we came to stop them. Alas, their sorcery is powerful beyond belief. Many of our disciples have perished. Ah… I have failed them.”

The hall fell silent in mourning. Xiao Yicai gently said, “Venerable One, please don’t blame yourself. Those who perished have gone on to paradise. What matters now is how we resist the demonic scourge.”

Abbot Puhong sighed, glancing around at the disciples of Qingyun Sect. “The situation is dire. Only your sect’s Master Dao Xuan remains as the last hope of the righteous path. The mighty Zhu Xian Sword Formation may yet turn the tide and save the people. Amitabha… I entrust this to you.”

He bowed deeply. To his surprise, the Qingyun disciples all averted their eyes in silence. The abbot’s brows furrowed. “Forgive me for asking…”

Xiao Yicai forced a bitter smile. “Perhaps the Venerable One has not yet heard… our master… has been missing for days.”

The monks of Tianyin Temple exchanged shocked glances. Abbot Puhong asked gravely, “What happened?”

Xiao Yicai sighed. “There’s no need to hide the truth anymore. Ever since Master Dao Xuan used the Zhu Xian Formation to defeat the Beast God, he began to show strange behavior…”

A flood of blood-red surged across the sky.

Above Thông Thiên Peak, the entire sky had turned a deep crimson. Towering black clouds rolled and churned, making it hard to breathe just by looking. Beneath that blood-red canopy, everything was stained the same hue—red sky, red mountains, the mist drifting over the sea of clouds was red, the droplets trickling beneath the Scarlet Bridge were red, even the harsh mountain winds seemed tinged with red.

The stench of blood wafted thickly in the air, rising to flood Thông Thiên Peak.

From all directions, people swarmed up the mountain in droves, so densely packed that not a single gap could be seen. Everywhere, people crawled and scrambled, their eyes gleaming an eerie, bloodshot red. Judging by their clothing, most of these frenzied masses were common folk from the foot of Qing Yun Mountain. But how could mere civilians move with such agility, like monkeys or apes? Naturally, it was the influence of that eerie crimson light that had stolen their sanity.

With no real effort, the Ghost King had summoned such a vast army through the Four Sacred Blood Formation. And with the same formation, he had turned weak-willed villagers into powerful berserkers capable of overwhelming forces many times their strength. It was enough to prove that there was no conceivable way to counter his power. One crazed commoner might be nothing to a disciple of Qing Yun Sect, but what about a hundred, a thousand? Now, there were nearly a hundred thousand of them, covering the forests and mountains like a maddened swarm of ants. The sight alone was enough to make one's hair stand on end.

Among the writhing throng were many whose excitement over the blood-colored sky was especially intense. Their cultivation was clearly far beyond that of the frenzied commoners around them. They flew swiftly on swords, mimicking the techniques of true cultivators—and not poorly either. Some of them even surpassed the Qing Yun disciples stationed there. It was no mystery why—these were righteous cultivators who had once fought in previous battles, but whose minds had now been seized by the Ghost King.

With so many elite fighters and an endless tide of madmen, the Demonic Sect’s assault surged like an unstoppable tidal wave crashing ashore. Beneath the blood-soaked sky, the Qing Yun disciples guarding Vân Hải could barely hold their ground. They fell back, retreating in clusters toward the Scarlet Bridge.

Before long, accompanied by wave after wave of ominous shuffling sounds, the Demonic Sect’s army from all directions had overrun the vast plaza of Vân Hải. The once ethereal mountain, wreathed in drifting clouds, had become a roiling sea of heads and a cacophony of shrieks and howls. It was a scene straight from the abyss. More and more people poured in—until there was no room left even to stand.

Zhang Xiaofan slowly opened his eyes.

In front of him were not the mountains and caves as he had imagined, all around him was a terrifying desolation.

An endless stretch of desert, without a single leaf or blade of grass, all around were just piles of sand and rocks, the wind blew and blew away the dust. Above his head was a majestic blue sky, dark purple clouds pressed down heavily as if to sink people to the ground. In that strange layer of clouds, bright lightning bolts shot towards the distant horizon.

That horizon was a dark blue sky, countless brilliant stars shining brightly. Zhang Xiaofan withdrew his gaze and looked ahead. In the cold desert, in the distance stood an altar built from large stone slabs, with steps seven stories high on all four sides. On the altar were seven large pillars, each pillar was ten zhang tall, as big as three human arms. In the middle of the altar was an ancient incense burner. An old man was leaning against the cauldron, looking extremely tired. That old man was staring intently at Zhang Xiaofan.

Xiaofan recognized that person, and couldn't help but shiver. That old man was indeed Dao Xuan Zhenren, the current head of Qingyun Sect.

A cold black aura was hovering around Dao Xuan Zhenren, and upon closer inspection, he no longer had the appearance of a Taoist immortal commanding the world like he knew before, but only exuded an indescribable viciousness.

Dao Xuan Zhenren lazily stood up, and suddenly laughed out loud: "I didn't expect you to have passed through the Ao Yue Dao by yourself, very good!"

Zhang Xiaofan pondered for a moment, then turned around and looked up, only to see that the place he had just stepped out of was a towering stone door, completely unlike the desolate scene of the surrounding world. Inside the stone door, the path he had just passed through was faintly visible, faintly visible in the fluttering white smoke. That seemingly harmless and harmless road, it seemed like it would take him a lifetime to walk through it.

Zhang Xiaofan recalled the pain he had just experienced, and a feeling of fear suddenly arose in his heart. But after a moment, a smile appeared on the corner of his lips, and he turned back to face Daoxuan Zhenren.

The person in front of him, could be said to have directly caused the death of his beloved master Tian Buyi, who he respected the most, and also indirectly killed his master's wife Su Ru, but now he was incredibly old and weak, and no longer had any of his previous intimidating appearance. In Zhang Xiaofan's heart, there was not even the slightest thought of revenge.

"Are you okay?" Zhang Xiaofan walked in front of Daoxuan Zhenren, and asked calmly.

Daoxuan Zhenren looked at him, a strange smile suddenly appeared on his tired face, not mentioning any past grudges, but only asking a seemingly meaningless question: "What are you doing here?"

Zhang Xiaofan pondered for a moment, then replied: "I feel like I'll come if I want to!"

Daoxuan Zhenren stared at him, then shook his head and laughed: "Very good, if I want to come, then come, hahaha..."

His laughter became more and more crazy, the expression on his face seemed to become more and more intense. Zhang Xiaofan just stood there quietly watching. After a long while, Daoxuan Zhenren stopped laughing, his expression suddenly became extremely tired.

"Aren't you going to avenge your master?"

Daoxuan Zhenren suddenly asked harshly. Zhang Xiaofan didn't answer, still standing there quietly looking at him. His eyes were calm and composed, seemingly hiding a bit of sadness. The monkey Xiaohui suddenly moved and crawled out to sit on his shoulder.

Daoxuan Zhenren's body suddenly jerked, his expression gradually changed. The tiredness disappeared, his eyes suddenly lit up strangely. The world-shaking aura rose like a tidal wave, quickly invading his entire being.

That terrifying invisible power made Xiao Fan narrow his eyes. Dao Xuan Zhenren stood up, the black aura on his body quickly surrounded Zhang Xiao Fan. He stared at him, sneering viciously: "Then, are you afraid?"

Suddenly a loud "Bang" came from behind Dao Xuan Zhenren, the ancient cauldron shattered in an instant, fragments flying in all directions. Zhang Xiao Fan took a step back, raising his hand to cover his face.

A sword fell from the ancient cauldron, the sharp blade embedded into the stone platform like it was stuck in mud.

Tru Tien Ancient Sword!

"Ha ha ha ha ha!"

The black aura swirled and covered Dao Xuan Zhenren, he stretched out his hand. As if it had a spirit, Tru Tien Ancient Sword shook and bounced off the stone, flying into Dao Xuan's hand while his crazy laughter continued.

"If you are so useless, then let me send you to see your master, ha ha ha ha...!"

Dao Xuan Zhenren laughed evilly, exerting his strength to grip the handle of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword. In an instant, the entire giant altar shook. A terrifying power emanated from the ancient sword, causing the seven stone pillars to shake and shine, the light growing stronger and stronger. Finally, all seven stone pillars transformed into seven dazzling seven-colored pillars of light, shining straight up into the sky.

The seven seven-colored pillars of light pierced straight through the clouds. In an instant, the thick clouds above the altar began to rotate violently. Flashes of lightning split the sky, faintly revealing the scene of the Heavenly Palace.

Zhang Xiaofan held his breath and looked up at the sky. Only then did he understand why this place was called the Ao Yue Cave Mansion.

The towering Heavenly Palace was torn apart by the terrifying power of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword, revealing a bright and mysterious moon. The colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple flickered on the distant Ao Yue, emitting mysterious and brilliant lights.

The seven pillars of light on the altar suddenly rose and merged with the Ao Yue, making the Ao Yue's light even stronger, the seven colors flashing continuously. The next moment, a seven-colored sword appeared from within the Ao Yue. Wherever the sword went, the dark clouds disappeared, its terrifying power was unimaginable if one did not see it.

Zhang Xiaofan's face had turned pale, he had never witnessed such power before, it was truly an invincible ancient and modern sword formation! In just a moment, countless Tru Tien Ancient Swords appeared and flew across the sky. Under the light of the Illusionary Moon, the master sword became more and more majestic and powerful, even more powerful than when it was on the altar.

The eyes of Dao Xuan Zhenren changed from bright to dark, and a cold laughter rang out as if piercing Zhang Xiaofan's ears:

"In the Illusionary Moon Cave Mansion, the power of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword is even more powerful. Even if you are a Great Luo Golden Immortal, your bones will be crushed to pieces, understand?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the sword in his hand spun again, and in an instant, the sky and earth shook, the wind and clouds changed color, and thunder rumbled in the sky. In the blue sky, the great sword appeared and disappeared, pointing straight at Zhang Xiaofan.

The sword shadow swooped down, and a storm arose. Zhang Xiaofan understood that he could not resist, and there was no way to dodge. Who would have thought that even the heavens would have to turn before the Tru Tien Ancient Sword? A ray of light covered the entire altar, seemingly crushing Xiaofan's body. Under that terrible weight, his legs gradually collapsed. The ground beneath his feet shook unceasingly. Within a few dozen square meters, the ground cracked open like a turtle's hood.

The power of the sword was unimaginable. Ever since the Tru Tien Ancient Sword broke and lay under the Ao Nguyet, no one expected its power to be stronger than ever. Heaven and earth were still cracking, how could humans survive? No matter how high one's cultivation was, one could only close one's eyes and wait for death!

In that moment between life and death, Zhang Xiaofan's heart was extremely calm, like someone who had traveled far away and was about to return home, his lips still showing a calm and composed smile.

Perhaps the Heavens did not want him to die. When Zhang Xiaofan was about to die, a call came from afar.

"Senior Brother, stop!"

The voice sounded very youthful, but there was an immense power hidden in it. It seemed like that person just said it casually, but that short sentence shook people's hearts, making their blood boil.

Heaven and earth were turned upside down, ghosts and gods could not stop the power of the Tru Tien ancient sword. Suddenly, everything stopped, it seemed like Dao Xuan Zhenren with his invincible power in his hand had to be wary of that voice. The vicious features on his face suddenly disappeared, he looked behind Xiao Fan in shock. His voice also became intermittently trembling.

"Junior brother... Junior brother Wan...!"

The pressure on Xiao Fan's body suddenly disappeared, the cracks under his feet also reconnected as if nothing had happened. Looking back, he only saw a white-clothed figure standing right next to the door where he had just passed.

It was a handsome young man, a warm smile on his lips, his eyes exuding enthusiasm and trust. The desert wind blew strongly, the white robe on his body fluttered, elegant and proud. Looking at that person, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt a sense of admiration and love. As long as that person said one word, he would not hesitate to follow him to the ends of the earth!

The endless blue sky, the sparkling Ao Yue.

The two elite disciples of Qingyun Sect, separated for so many years, now met again in a mysterious and empty space.

The body of Dao Xuan Zhenren slowly trembled, the Tru Tien Ancient Sword in his hand slowly lowered. He walked heavily away from the altar, walking towards that white figure, not even looking at Zhang Xiaofan.

The white robe fluttered, the radiant face of the passionate past in his memories emitted a bright light. That warm and passionate light was once the most dear thing in Dao Xuan Zhenren's heart. His eyes, which had long been dry, shed hot tears: "Junior Brother... is it really you?"

The white-clothed youth stood there, not moving away from the stone door, smiling: "Senior Brother, how are you? How long has it been since we last saw each other?"

Dao Xuan Zhenren's entire body trembled slightly, even though he still held the ancient Tru Tien sword in his hand, the dark energy on his body had completely dissipated. At that moment, the pain in Zhang Xiaofan's body disappeared, and his expression returned to a calm and composed state.

Mount Qingyun, as high as the heavens.

From the summit, the horizon no longer stretched out in its usual infinite blue. Instead, ominous blood-red clouds were gathering, slowly creeping toward the peak of Mount Qingyun.

Within the Qingyun Sect, chaos reigned like never before. The infiltration by the Demonic Cult this time had unleashed an unimaginable force. In a single day, the righteous sects had lost nearly all of their strength, standing on the brink of annihilation. Their downfall was not just due to the brutal battles, but also the mysterious and sinister sorcery wielded by the Ghost King. Under this malevolent power, righteous disciples could no longer recognize their comrades, turning on one another as though sworn enemies.

With but a wave of his hand, the Ghost King had thrown heaven and earth into turmoil. Countless righteous cultivators had lost their minds, becoming ruthless killing machines under the control of the Demonic Cult. Now, with over a hundred thousand under his command, the Ghost King had forged a force powerful enough to shake the very heavens.

Qingyun Sect was the last bastion of the righteous path. Even the once-prestigious Tianyin Temple had fallen into enemy hands, leaving only a dozen high-ranking monks who had managed to escape and now sought refuge with the Qingyun Sect. Among them were the venerable Abbot Puhong, the divine monk Pukong, and the gifted disciple Faxiang. One other figure stood quietly among them — a gaunt, silent elder monk who always remained by Abbot Puhong’s side.

News of the Tianyin Temple’s calamity stirred the sect. For years, the Qingyun Sect and the Tianyin Temple had shared a close alliance, always standing shoulder to shoulder in times of crisis. As the monks approached the sect's main hall, the disciples of Qingyun gathered en masse to welcome them. But upon seeing the monks’ bloodstained robes and grief-stricken faces, a heavy silence fell upon the crowd.

The leadership of Qingyun Sect now fell to Xiao Yicai, who was temporarily handling affairs, along with Zeng Shuchang of Great Bamboo Peak and Master Shuiyue of Small Bamboo Peak. Zeng Shuchang scanned the monks’ faces and saw only sorrow. Their bloodied robes told tales of desperate battle. Tianyin Temple had once flourished with disciples — and now, only a handful remained. Could it be...

Zeng Shuchang stepped forward, hesitating before asking with difficulty, “Venerable Abbot Puhong, the others… have they…”

Abbot Puhong clasped his hands solemnly in greeting. “In this great disaster, all beings are but ashes. We monks of Tianyin sought to save lives, but as our skills grew by an inch, the demonic sorcery grew by a yard. Most of our disciples have perished.”

With that, he sighed and murmured, “Amitabha.”

Zeng Shuchang remained silent, his expression pained. Xiao Yicai tried to remain composed, but the forced smile on his face betrayed the weight of sorrow: “Regardless, your arrival is a blessing. Please, come inside.”

The monks clasped their hands in return and followed him toward the Jade Heaven Hall. Behind them, the blood-red clouds loomed heavier, as though threatening to crush the sky itself.

Master Shuiyue turned to see her disciple Lu Xueqi lingering by the railing of a side stair, gazing into the distance with a troubled expression. She opened her mouth to call out, then paused, seemingly recalling something. Quietly, she approached and said softly, “Xueqi.”

Startled, Lu Xueqi turned and quickly nodded, “Master, I’ll be there shortly.”

She was about to step forward when Shuiyue gently grasped her hand and led her aside.

Lu Xueqi looked at her, puzzled. “Master, what is this?”

Shuiyue exhaled deeply, lowered her voice, and said with great tenderness, “Xueqi, you must leave.”

Lu Xueqi’s eyes widened. “Master, where should I go?”

The master’s gaze fell upon the distant blood-red clouds. Her voice dropped even lower. “Leave Mount Qingyun. Find the one you long for. Go to a place where your heart belongs. Live a happy life… with the one you love.”

She turned her eyes toward her disciple, her tone resolute. “Never come back.”

Lu Xueqi turned pale. Tears welled up in her eyes. After a long pause, she shook her head and whispered firmly, “Master, I won’t go. I want to stay here with you.”

Shuiyue smiled bitterly. “Foolish child, I’ve lived a long life. I have no regrets, even if I die today. But you are young, and you have love in your life. Please, listen to me. Leave Mount Qingyun. Go and be with the one you love…”

Tears streamed down Lu Xueqi’s face. Her whole body trembled as she struggled with the storm of emotions inside her. But in the end, she turned and walked toward the Jade Heaven Hall.

Master Shuiyue watched her slender figure recede into the distance, sighed heavily, and slowly followed. She paused, glancing toward a corner of the courtyard where a young man and woman whispered to one another. The girl was her disciple Wen Min, and the man, Song Daren of Great Bamboo Peak. Worry lined their faces, but the way they looked at each other — so tender, so full of affection — made her heart ache even more.

She lowered her eyes and continued toward the hall.

Inside, the disciples and monks had taken their seats. Though the revered Abbot Puhong was offered the seat of honor, he firmly declined, and so the chair remained empty. The representatives of the righteous sects filled the hall.

Zeng Shuchang cleared his throat and asked, “Venerable Abbot, has the area surrounding Tianyin Temple also been destroyed by the demonic cult?”

Abbot Puhong shook his head. “The merciful Buddha still watches over the common people. The demon cult has yet to reach them. But hearing that the evil ones had returned to slaughter and bring calamity, we came to stop them. Alas, their sorcery is powerful beyond belief. Many of our disciples have perished. Ah… I have failed them.”

The hall fell silent in mourning. Xiao Yicai gently said, “Venerable One, please don’t blame yourself. Those who perished have gone on to paradise. What matters now is how we resist the demonic scourge.”

Abbot Puhong sighed, glancing around at the disciples of Qingyun Sect. “The situation is dire. Only your sect’s Master Dao Xuan remains as the last hope of the righteous path. The mighty Zhu Xian Sword Formation may yet turn the tide and save the people. Amitabha… I entrust this to you.”

He bowed deeply. To his surprise, the Qingyun disciples all averted their eyes in silence. The abbot’s brows furrowed. “Forgive me for asking…”

Xiao Yicai forced a bitter smile. “Perhaps the Venerable One has not yet heard… our master… has been missing for days.”

The monks of Tianyin Temple exchanged shocked glances. Abbot Puhong asked gravely, “What happened?”

Xiao Yicai sighed. “There’s no need to hide the truth anymore. Ever since Master Dao Xuan used the Zhu Xian Formation to defeat the Beast God, he began to show strange behavior…”

A flood of blood-red surged across the sky.

Above Thông Thiên Peak, the entire sky had turned a deep crimson. Towering black clouds rolled and churned, making it hard to breathe just by looking. Beneath that blood-red canopy, everything was stained the same hue—red sky, red mountains, the mist drifting over the sea of clouds was red, the droplets trickling beneath the Scarlet Bridge were red, even the harsh mountain winds seemed tinged with red.

The stench of blood wafted thickly in the air, rising to flood Thông Thiên Peak.

From all directions, people swarmed up the mountain in droves, so densely packed that not a single gap could be seen. Everywhere, people crawled and scrambled, their eyes gleaming an eerie, bloodshot red. Judging by their clothing, most of these frenzied masses were common folk from the foot of Qing Yun Mountain. But how could mere civilians move with such agility, like monkeys or apes? Naturally, it was the influence of that eerie crimson light that had stolen their sanity.

And with the same formation, he had turned weak-willed villagers into powerful berserkers capable of overwhelming forces many times their strength. It was enough to prove that there was no conceivable way to counter his power. One crazed commoner might be nothing to a disciple of Qing Yun Sect, but what about a hundred, a thousand? Now, there were nearly a hundred thousand of them, covering the forests and mountains like a maddened swarm of ants. The sight alone was enough to make one's hair stand on end.

Among the writhing throng were many whose excitement over the blood-colored sky was especially intense. Their cultivation was clearly far beyond that of the frenzied commoners around them. They flew swiftly on swords, mimicking the techniques of true cultivators—and not poorly either. Some of them even surpassed the Qing Yun disciples stationed there. It was no mystery why—these were righteous cultivators who had once fought in previous battles, but whose minds had now been seized by the Ghost King.

With so many elite fighters and an endless tide of madmen, the Demonic Sect’s assault surged like an unstoppable tidal wave crashing ashore. Beneath the blood-soaked sky, the Qing Yun disciples guarding Vân Hải could barely hold their ground. They fell back, retreating in clusters toward the Scarlet Bridge.

Before long, accompanied by wave after wave of ominous shuffling sounds, the Demonic Sect’s army from all directions had overrun the vast plaza of Vân Hải. The once ethereal mountain, wreathed in drifting clouds, had become a roiling sea of heads and a cacophony of shrieks and howls. It was a scene straight from the abyss. More and more people poured in—until there was no room left even to stand.

Zhang Xiaofan slowly opened his eyes.

In front of him were not the mountains and caves as he had imagined, all around him was a terrifying desolation.

An endless stretch of desert, without a single leaf or blade of grass, all around were just piles of sand and rocks, the wind blew and blew away the dust. Above his head was a majestic blue sky, dark purple clouds pressed down heavily as if to sink people to the ground. In that strange layer of clouds, bright lightning bolts shot towards the distant horizon.

That horizon was a dark blue sky, countless brilliant stars shining brightly. Zhang Xiaofan withdrew his gaze and looked ahead. In the cold desert, in the distance stood an altar built from large stone slabs, with steps seven stories high on all four sides. On the altar were seven large pillars, each pillar was ten zhang tall, as big as three human arms. In the middle of the altar was an ancient incense burner. An old man was leaning against the cauldron, looking extremely tired. That old man was staring intently at Zhang Xiaofan.

Xiaofan recognized that person, and couldn't help but shiver. That old man was indeed Dao Xuan Zhenren, the current head of Qingyun Sect.

A cold black aura was hovering around Dao Xuan Zhenren, and upon closer inspection, he no longer had the appearance of a Taoist immortal commanding the world like he knew before, but only exuded an indescribable viciousness.

Dao Xuan Zhenren lazily stood up, and suddenly laughed out loud: "I didn't expect you to have passed through the Ao Yue Dao by yourself, very good!"

Zhang Xiaofan pondered for a moment, then turned around and looked up, only to see that the place he had just stepped out of was a towering stone door, completely unlike the desolate scene of the surrounding world. Inside the stone door, the path he had just passed through was faintly visible, faintly visible in the fluttering white smoke. That seemingly harmless and harmless road, it seemed like it would take him a lifetime to walk through it.

Zhang Xiaofan recalled the pain he had just experienced, and a feeling of fear suddenly arose in his heart. But after a moment, a smile appeared on the corner of his lips, and he turned back to face Daoxuan Zhenren.

The person in front of him, could be said to have directly caused the death of his beloved master Tian Buyi, who he respected the most, and also indirectly killed his master's wife Su Ru, but now he was incredibly old and weak, and no longer had any of his previous intimidating appearance. In Zhang Xiaofan's heart, there was not even the slightest thought of revenge.

"Are you okay?" Zhang Xiaofan walked in front of Daoxuan Zhenren, and asked calmly.

Daoxuan Zhenren looked at him, a strange smile suddenly appeared on his tired face, not mentioning any past grudges, but only asking a seemingly meaningless question: "What are you doing here?"

Zhang Xiaofan pondered for a moment, then replied: "I feel like I'll come if I want to!"

Daoxuan Zhenren stared at him, then shook his head and laughed: "Very good, if I want to come, then come, hahaha..."

His laughter became more and more crazy, the expression on his face seemed to become more and more intense. Zhang Xiaofan just stood there quietly watching. After a long while, Daoxuan Zhenren stopped laughing, his expression suddenly became extremely tired.

"Aren't you going to avenge your master?"

Daoxuan Zhenren suddenly asked harshly. Zhang Xiaofan didn't answer, still standing there quietly looking at him. His eyes were calm and composed, seemingly hiding a bit of sadness. The monkey Xiaohui suddenly moved and crawled out to sit on his shoulder.

Daoxuan Zhenren's body suddenly jerked, his expression gradually changed. The tiredness disappeared, his eyes suddenly lit up strangely. The world-shaking aura rose like a tidal wave, quickly invading his entire being.

That terrifying invisible power made Xiao Fan narrow his eyes. Dao Xuan Zhenren stood up, the black aura on his body quickly surrounded Zhang Xiao Fan. He stared at him, sneering viciously: "Then, are you afraid?"

Suddenly a loud "Bang" came from behind Dao Xuan Zhenren, the ancient cauldron shattered in an instant, fragments flying in all directions. Zhang Xiao Fan took a step back, raising his hand to cover his face.

A sword fell from the ancient cauldron, the sharp blade embedded into the stone platform like it was stuck in mud.

Tru Tien Ancient Sword!

"Ha ha ha ha ha!"

The black aura swirled and covered Dao Xuan Zhenren, he stretched out his hand. As if it had a spirit, Tru Tien Ancient Sword shook and bounced off the stone, flying into Dao Xuan's hand while his crazy laughter continued.

"If you are so useless, then let me send you to see your master, ha ha ha ha...!"

Dao Xuan Zhenren laughed evilly, exerting his strength to grip the handle of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword. In an instant, the entire giant altar shook. A terrifying power emanated from the ancient sword, causing the seven stone pillars to shake and shine, the light growing stronger and stronger. Finally, all seven stone pillars transformed into seven dazzling seven-colored pillars of light, shining straight up into the sky.

The seven seven-colored pillars of light pierced straight through the clouds. In an instant, the thick clouds above the altar began to rotate violently. Flashes of lightning split the sky, faintly revealing the scene of the Heavenly Palace.

Zhang Xiaofan held his breath and looked up at the sky. Only then did he understand why this place was called the Ao Yue Cave Mansion.

The towering Heavenly Palace was torn apart by the terrifying power of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword, revealing a bright and mysterious moon. The colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple flickered on the distant Ao Yue, emitting mysterious and brilliant lights.

The seven pillars of light on the altar suddenly rose and merged with the Ao Yue, making the Ao Yue's light even stronger, the seven colors flashing continuously. The next moment, a seven-colored sword appeared from within the Ao Yue. Wherever the sword went, the dark clouds disappeared, its terrifying power was unimaginable if one did not see it.

Zhang Xiaofan's face had turned pale, he had never witnessed such power before, it was truly an invincible ancient and modern sword formation! In just a moment, countless Tru Tien Ancient Swords appeared and flew across the sky. Under the light of the Illusionary Moon, the master sword became more and more majestic and powerful, even more powerful than when it was on the altar.

The eyes of Dao Xuan Zhenren changed from bright to dark, and a cold laughter rang out as if piercing Zhang Xiaofan's ears:

"In the Illusionary Moon Cave Mansion, the power of the Tru Tien Ancient Sword is even more powerful. Even if you are a Great Luo Golden Immortal, your bones will be crushed to pieces, understand?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the sword in his hand spun again, and in an instant, the sky and earth shook, the wind and clouds changed color, and thunder rumbled in the sky. In the blue sky, the great sword appeared and disappeared, pointing straight at Zhang Xiaofan.

The sword shadow swooped down, and a storm arose. Zhang Xiaofan understood that he could not resist, and there was no way to dodge. Who would have thought that even the heavens would have to turn before the Tru Tien Ancient Sword? A ray of light covered the entire altar, seemingly crushing Xiaofan's body. Under that terrible weight, his legs gradually collapsed. The ground beneath his feet shook unceasingly. Within a few dozen square meters, the ground cracked open like a turtle's hood.

The power of the sword was unimaginable. Ever since the Tru Tien Ancient Sword broke and lay under the Ao Nguyet, no one expected its power to be stronger than ever. Heaven and earth were still cracking, how could humans survive? No matter how high one's cultivation was, one could only close one's eyes and wait for death!

In that moment between life and death, Zhang Xiaofan's heart was extremely calm, like someone who had traveled far away and was about to return home, his lips still showing a calm and composed smile.

Perhaps the Heavens did not want him to die. When Zhang Xiaofan was about to die, a call came from afar.

"Senior Brother, stop!"

The voice sounded very youthful, but there was an immense power hidden in it. It seemed like that person just said it casually, but that short sentence shook people's hearts, making their blood boil.

Heaven and earth were turned upside down, ghosts and gods could not stop the power of the Tru Tien ancient sword. Suddenly, everything stopped, it seemed like Dao Xuan Zhenren with his invincible power in his hand had to be wary of that voice. The vicious features on his face suddenly disappeared, he looked behind Xiao Fan in shock. His voice also became intermittently trembling.

"Junior brother... Junior brother Wan...!"

The pressure on Xiao Fan's body suddenly disappeared, the cracks under his feet also reconnected as if nothing had happened. Looking back, he only saw a white-clothed figure standing right next to the door where he had just passed.

It was a handsome young man, a warm smile on his lips, his eyes exuding enthusiasm and trust. The desert wind blew strongly, the white robe on his body fluttered, elegant and proud. Looking at that person, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt a sense of admiration and love. As long as that person said one word, he would not hesitate to follow him to the ends of the earth!

The endless blue sky, the sparkling Ao Yue.

The two elite disciples of Qingyun Sect, separated for so many years, now met again in a mysterious and empty space.

The body of Dao Xuan Zhenren slowly trembled, the Tru Tien Ancient Sword in his hand slowly lowered. He walked heavily away from the altar, walking towards that white figure, not even looking at Zhang Xiaofan.

The white robe fluttered, the radiant face of the passionate past in his memories emitted a bright light. That warm and passionate light was once the most dear thing in Dao Xuan Zhenren's heart. His eyes, which had long been dry, shed hot tears: "Junior Brother... is it really you?"

The white-clothed youth stood there, not moving away from the stone door, smiling: "Senior Brother, how are you? How long has it been since we last saw each other?"

Dao Xuan Zhenren's entire body trembled slightly, even though he still held the ancient Tru Tien sword in his hand, the dark energy on his body had completely dissipated. At that moment, the pain in Zhang Xiaofan's body disappeared, and his expression returned to a calm and composed state.

Mount Qingyun, as high as the heavens.

From the summit, the horizon no longer stretched out in its usual infinite blue. Instead, ominous blood-red clouds were gathering, slowly creeping toward the peak of Mount Qingyun.

Within the Qingyun Sect, chaos reigned like never before. The infiltration by the Demonic Cult this time had unleashed an unimaginable force. In a single day, the righteous sects had lost nearly all of their strength, standing on the brink of annihilation. Their downfall was not just due to the brutal battles, but also the mysterious and sinister sorcery wielded by the Ghost King. Under this malevolent power, righteous disciples could no longer recognize their comrades, turning on one another as though sworn enemies.

With but a wave of his hand, the Ghost King had thrown heaven and earth into turmoil. Countless righteous cultivators had lost their minds, becoming ruthless killing machines under the control of the Demonic Cult. Now, with over a hundred thousand under his command, the Ghost King had forged a force powerful enough to shake the very heavens.

Qingyun Sect was the last bastion of the righteous path. Even the once-prestigious Tianyin Temple had fallen into enemy hands, leaving only a dozen high-ranking monks who had managed to escape and now sought refuge with the Qingyun Sect. Among them were the venerable Abbot Puhong, the divine monk Pukong, and the gifted disciple Faxiang. One other figure stood quietly among them — a gaunt, silent elder monk who always remained by Abbot Puhong’s side.

News of the Tianyin Temple’s calamity stirred the sect. For years, the Qingyun Sect and the Tianyin Temple had shared a close alliance, always standing shoulder to shoulder in times of crisis. As the monks approached the sect's main hall, the disciples of Qingyun gathered en masse to welcome them. But upon seeing the monks’ bloodstained robes and grief-stricken faces, a heavy silence fell upon the crowd.

The leadership of Qingyun Sect now fell to Xiao Yicai, who was temporarily handling affairs, along with Zeng Shuchang of Great Bamboo Peak and Master Shuiyue of Small Bamboo Peak. Zeng Shuchang scanned the monks’ faces and saw only sorrow. Their bloodied robes told tales of desperate battle. Tianyin Temple had once flourished with disciples — and now, only a handful remained. Could it be...

Zeng Shuchang stepped forward, hesitating before asking with difficulty, “Venerable Abbot Puhong, the others… have they…”

Abbot Puhong clasped his hands solemnly in greeting. “In this great disaster, all beings are but ashes. We monks of Tianyin sought to save lives, but as our skills grew by an inch, the demonic sorcery grew by a yard. Most of our disciples have perished.”

With that, he sighed and murmured, “Amitabha.”

Zeng Shuchang remained silent, his expression pained. Xiao Yicai tried to remain composed, but the forced smile on his face betrayed the weight of sorrow: “Regardless, your arrival is a blessing. Please, come inside.”

The monks clasped their hands in return and followed him toward the Jade Heaven Hall. Behind them, the blood-red clouds loomed heavier, as though threatening to crush the sky itself.

Master Shuiyue turned to see her disciple Lu Xueqi lingering by the railing of a side stair, gazing into the distance with a troubled expression. She opened her mouth to call out, then paused, seemingly recalling something. Quietly, she approached and said softly, “Xueqi.”

Startled, Lu Xueqi turned and quickly nodded, “Master, I’ll be there shortly.”

She was about to step forward when Shuiyue gently grasped her hand and led her aside.

Lu Xueqi looked at her, puzzled. “Master, what is this?”

Shuiyue exhaled deeply, lowered her voice, and said with great tenderness, “Xueqi, you must leave.”

Lu Xueqi’s eyes widened. “Master, where should I go?”

The master’s gaze fell upon the distant blood-red clouds. Her voice dropped even lower. “Leave Mount Qingyun. Find the one you long for. Go to a place where your heart belongs. Live a happy life… with the one you love.”

She turned her eyes toward her disciple, her tone resolute. “Never come back.”

Lu Xueqi turned pale. Tears welled up in her eyes. After a long pause, she shook her head and whispered firmly, “Master, I won’t go. I want to stay here with you.”

Shuiyue smiled bitterly. “Foolish child, I’ve lived a long life. I have no regrets, even if I die today. But you are young, and you have love in your life. Please, listen to me. Leave Mount Qingyun. Go and be with the one you love…”

Tears streamed down Lu Xueqi’s face. Her whole body trembled as she struggled with the storm of emotions inside her. But in the end, she turned and walked toward the Jade Heaven Hall.

Master Shuiyue watched her slender figure recede into the distance, sighed heavily, and slowly followed. She paused, glancing toward a corner of the courtyard where a young man and woman whispered to one another. The girl was her disciple Wen Min, and the man, Song Daren of Great Bamboo Peak. Worry lined their faces, but the way they looked at each other — so tender, so full of affection — made her heart ache even more.

She lowered her eyes and continued toward the hall.

Inside, the disciples and monks had taken their seats. Though the revered Abbot Puhong was offered the seat of honor, he firmly declined, and so the chair remained empty. The representatives of the righteous sects filled the hall.

Zeng Shuchang cleared his throat and asked, “Venerable Abbot, has the area surrounding Tianyin Temple also been destroyed by the demonic cult?”

Abbot Puhong shook his head. “The merciful Buddha still watches over the common people. The demon cult has yet to reach them. But hearing that the evil ones had returned to slaughter and bring calamity, we came to stop them. Alas, their sorcery is powerful beyond belief. Many of our disciples have perished. Ah… I have failed them.”

The hall fell silent in mourning. Xiao Yicai gently said, “Venerable One, please don’t blame yourself. Those who perished have gone on to paradise. What matters now is how we resist the demonic scourge.”

Abbot Puhong sighed, glancing around at the disciples of Qingyun Sect. “The situation is dire. Only your sect’s Master Dao Xuan remains as the last hope of the righteous path. The mighty Zhu Xian Sword Formation may yet turn the tide and save the people. Amitabha… I entrust this to you.”

He bowed deeply. To his surprise, the Qingyun disciples all averted their eyes in silence. The abbot’s brows furrowed. “Forgive me for asking…”

Xiao Yicai forced a bitter smile. “Perhaps the Venerable One has not yet heard… our master… has been missing for days.”

The monks of Tianyin Temple exchanged shocked glances. Abbot Puhong asked gravely, “What happened?”

Xiao Yicai sighed. “There’s no need to hide the truth anymore. Ever since Master Dao Xuan used the Zhu Xian Formation to defeat the Beast God, he began to show strange behavior…”

A flood of blood-red surged across the sky.

Above Thông Thiên Peak, the entire sky had turned a deep crimson. Towering black clouds rolled and churned, making it hard to breathe just by looking. Beneath that blood-red canopy, everything was stained the same hue—red sky, red mountains, the mist drifting over the sea of clouds was red, the droplets trickling beneath the Scarlet Bridge were red, even the harsh mountain winds seemed tinged with red.

The stench of blood wafted thickly in the air, rising to flood Thông Thiên Peak.

From all directions, people swarmed up the mountain in droves, so densely packed that not a single gap could be seen. Everywhere, people crawled and scrambled, their eyes gleaming an eerie, bloodshot red. Judging by their clothing, most of these frenzied masses were common folk from the foot of Qing Yun Mountain. But how could mere civilians move with such agility, like monkeys or apes? Naturally, it was the influence of that eerie crimson light that had stolen their sanity.

With no real effort, the Ghost King had summoned such a vast army through the Four Sacred Blood Formation. And with the same formation, he had turned weak-willed villagers into powerful berserkers capable of overwhelming forces many times their strength. It was enough to prove that there was no conceivable way to counter his power. One crazed commoner might be nothing to a disciple of Qing Yun Sect, but what about a hundred, a thousand? Now, there were nearly a hundred thousand of them, covering the forests and mountains like a maddened swarm of ants. The sight alone was enough to make one's hair stand on end.

Among the writhing throng were many whose excitement over the blood-colored sky was especially intense. Their cultivation was clearly far beyond that of the frenzied commoners around them. They flew swiftly on swords, mimicking the techniques of true cultivators—and not poorly either. Some of them even surpassed the Qing Yun disciples stationed there. It was no mystery why—these were righteous cultivators who had once fought in previous battles, but whose minds had now been seized by the Ghost King.

With so many elite fighters and an endless tide of madmen, the Demonic Sect’s assault surged like an unstoppable tidal wave crashing ashore. Beneath the blood-soaked sky, the Qing Yun disciples guarding Vân Hải could barely hold their ground. They fell back, retreating in clusters toward the Scarlet Bridge.

Before long, accompanied by wave after wave of ominous shuffling sounds, the Demonic Sect’s army from all directions had overrun the vast plaza of Vân Hải. The once ethereal mountain, wreathed in drifting clouds, had become a roiling sea of heads and a cacophony of shrieks and howls. It was a scene straight from the abyss. More and more people poured in—until there was no room left even to stand.
